In the summer of 1923, Li Rui, a gentleman from Xinzheng county, Henan province, drilled a well,
unwittingly dig out an ancient tomb and unearthed more than 100 bronzes.
After hearing the news, the commander of the 14th Division of the First Republic of China Army reported to general Wu Peifu.
then Wu Peifu ordered the division commander to transport the unearthed cultural relics to Kaifeng city for safekeeping for a long time.
In order to better preserve this batch of cultural relics,
the Henan Museum was founded in July 1927 under Feng Yuxiang's strong suggestion.
It was planned to be built on the site of Henan Province Law School and the Governor's Hill in Kaifeng city.



In 1961, along with the move of the provincial capital to Zhengzhou,
it moved to its current location.
In 1991 that museum was remodeled and in 1999 the official reopening was held.

The Henan Museum's buildings are spread out symmetrically in middle-high and tow flank side low arcs,
based on the earliest surviving observatory site in China,the Mongol Age Observatory in Dengfeng.
After artistic exaggeration, it is interpreted as a pyramid shape wearing a hat. There are nine overall buildings in total.
The symmetrical layout of the center of traditional Chinese architecture is adopted,
which has the implication of nine Ding setting the Central Plains(means the ruler controls the whole country in Chinese).

Henan is situated in the middle reaches of the Yellow River.
Its ancient name is Zhongzhou(中州), it's meaning central region in Chinese.
It is one of the important areas for the rise of the Chinese people's early civilization.
In the history of the Central Plains, more than 20 dynasties once established their capitals here.
Because of this, exhibitions in this museum are mostly related to the ancient history and culture of the Henan region,
including objects, historical traces, ancient architecture,
archaeological discoveries and arts and crafts、
prehistorical relics, bronze ware of Shang Dynasty and Zhou Dynasty,
jade ware and porcelain of the various dynasties in Chinese history,
and music show featuring mock ancient Chinese instruments thousands of years ago.
In addition to its collection of human history the museum is also home to many relics of natural history including dinosaur bones and fossils.

Henan Museum's present building, which opened in 1997, occupies an area of more than 100,000 square feet,
with a total floor space of 78,000 square feet.


The management structure of the Henan Museum is dominated by the government. There are 12 departments in total.
The museum is free to everyone, and tickets are free. Therefore, in order to maintain the operation of the museum,
they organized some cultural performances to generate income.

The Henan Museum is not only a building for storing antiques,
but also a spiritual cornerstone for local residents to help each other.
Just two months ago,
Zhengzhou City suffered an urban waterlogging caused by a heavy rainstorm.
The citizens rescued the trapped people during power outages and floods and generously donated supplies.

The jade ornament with human head and snake body is the first to be seen in jade artifacts unearthed so far,
and the image carved on it is probably related to the legendary ancestor Fuxi and Nuwa.
There are two jade ornaments in the shape of a flat oval ring, the same size and thickness.
Both jade ornaments are made of sideways human figures, with slightly different patterns on the front and back.
The one with the ring on the ear is male, and the other is female.
