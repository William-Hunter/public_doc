1923年夏，河南新郑一绅士李锐打井，无意间打出一座古墓，发掘出100多件青铜器。
北洋陆军14师师长闻讯后向吴佩孚驰报。吴佩孚命令该师长将出土文物运至开封妥善保管，以垂久远。
为了更好的保存这批文物，1927年7月在冯玉祥极力主张下于创立了河南博物馆，
筹建于开封三圣庙街河南法政学堂和河道总督衙门旧址。
In the summer of 1923, Li Rui, a gentleman from Xinzheng county, Henan province, drilled a well, 
unwittingly dig out an ancient tomb and unearthed more than 100 bronzes.
After hearing the news, the commander of the 14th Division of the First Republic of China Army reported to general Wu Peifu. 
then Wu Peifu ordered the division commander to transport the unearthed cultural relics to Kaifeng city for safekeeping for a long time.
In order to better preserve this batch of cultural relics, 
the Henan Museum was founded in July 1927 under Feng Yuxiang's strong suggestion. 
It was planned to be built on the site of Henan Province Law School and the Governor's Hill in Kaifeng city.


>* 迁都之后的renew

1961年，随着省城迁往郑州，迁至现址。 1991年改建，1999年正式开馆。
In 1961, along with the move of the provincial capital to Zhengzhou, 
it moved to its current location. 
In 1991 that museum was remodeled and in 1999 the official reopening was held.

河南博物馆建筑物以中高两低弧形方式将建筑平面对称铺开，以我国现存最早的天文台遗址——登封元代观星台为原型，
经艺术夸张演绎成戴帽子的金字塔造型，整体建筑共有九座，采取中国传统建筑中心对称布局，有九鼎定中原的寓意。

The Henan Museum's buildings are spread out symmetrically in middle-high and tow flank side low arcs, 
based on the earliest surviving observatory site in China,the Mongol Age Observatory in Dengfeng.
After artistic exaggeration, it is interpreted as a pyramid shape wearing a hat. There are nine overall buildings in total.
The symmetrical layout of the center of traditional Chinese architecture is adopted, 
which has the implication of nine Ding setting the Central Plains(means the ruler controls the whole country in Chinese).

河南地处黄河中游。
古称中州，即中部地区。
是中华民族早期文明兴起的重要地区之一。
在中原地区的历史上有多达20多个朝代曾经在此建都。
正因为如此，这个博物馆里的展品大多与河南地区古老的历史文化有关，
包括物品、历史遗迹、古建筑、
考古发现和艺术和手工艺、史前遗物、商周青铜器、中国历代玉器、瓷器，以及几千年前模拟古代乐器的音乐表演。
除了收藏人类历史外，该博物馆还收藏了许多自然历史遗迹，包括恐龙骨骼和化石。
Henan is situated in the middle reaches of the Yellow River.
Its ancient name is Zhongzhou(中州), it's meaning central region in Chinese.
It is one of the important areas for the rise of the Chinese people's early civilization.
In the history of the Central Plains, more than 20 dynasties once established their capitals here.
Because of this, exhibitions in this museum are mostly related to the ancient history and culture of the Henan region,
including objects, historical traces, ancient architecture,
archaeological discoveries and arts and crafts、
prehistorical relics, bronze ware of Shang Dynasty and Zhou Dynasty,
jade ware and porcelain of the various dynasties in Chinese history,
and music show featuring mock ancient Chinese instruments thousands of years ago.

>* 赞助者是谁，以及他们是如何在灾难中互帮互助的，捐款

河南博物馆不仅仅是一个存放古董的建筑物，更是当地居民互相帮助的精神基石。
就在两个月前，郑州市遭遇了一场及其大的暴雨形成的城市内涝，市民们在断电和洪水中营救被困者，慷慨的捐赠物资。
The Henan Museum is not only a building for storing antiques,
but also a spiritual cornerstone for local residents to help each other.
Just two months ago, 
Zhengzhou City suffered an urban waterlogging caused by a heavy rainstorm. 
The citizens rescued the trapped people during power outages and floods and generously donated supplies.
