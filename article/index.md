1923年夏，河南新郑一绅士李锐打井，无意间打出一座古墓，发掘出100多件青铜器。
北洋陆军14师师长闻讯后向吴佩孚驰报。吴佩孚命令该师长将出土文物运至开封妥善保管，以垂久远。
为了更好的保存这批文物，1927年7月在冯玉祥极力主张下于创立了河南博物馆，筹建于开封三圣庙街（今开封三胜街）河南法政学堂和河道总督衙门旧址。

the commander in chief of the National Revolutionary Army and the chairman of Henan Province at that time, 
proposed that “Education is the Essential Politics for a Country ”,

he was the commander in chief of the National Revolutionary Army,

In July, the founding committee of the Henan Museum was established. 
The site designated for the museum was the former Legal and Law School,
