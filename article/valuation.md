>“(...) we may all come out of Pissarro. He had the luck to be born in the Antilles, 
>there he learned drawing without a master. He told me all about it. 
>In 1865 he was already cutting out black, bitumen, raw sienna and the ochers. 
>That’s a fact. Never paint with anything but the three primary colors and their derivatives, 
>he used to say to me. Yes, he was the first Impressionist.”
