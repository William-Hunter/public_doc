# The Mountains & Seas Art Gallery



The Mountains & Seas Art gallery is an emerging gallery that serves the public in Zhengzhou which is located in a second-tier city. This city is where I lived in and it's an ancient city full of historical art pieces. This gallery is a contemporary art museum, which is very rare here. But we have a large population as well as young collectors and emerging artists. And it integrates the three core elements of exhibition collection, art derivation, and public education, and extensively cooperates with well-known and emerging artists in China and internationally to hold academic events. Extensive activities such as exhibitions and public projects bring out unlimited creativity, freedom, and a personalized art consumption experience. yet, this gallery has an operation in Beijing in 798 art district. However, due to the fierce competition, only the Zhengzhou pavilion was retained.

This gallery mainly sells photography and local artists' works. They have close relationships with about 20 local artists who work with photography, installations, paintings, and others. The boss is still looking for potential, so they will hold private receptions and gatherings to make this a social center for contemporary art.

The Mountains & Seas art gallery provides a place for the public to gather, communicate, communicate, learn, and share each other's interests and enthusiasm. The Mountains & Seas Art gallery's Public Projects Department has expanded this platform. Through lectures and forums, art theaters, live performances, workshops, youth art classes, etc. The art gallery becomes an open classroom, an indispensable public space in the city.
This is not only an exhibition but also a place for presentation and education. They are still doing some cultural and creative derivatives (souvenirs for sale). Because the owner has a very close relationship with collectors and artists, so they donâ€™t have a website. It is through Wechat to post and promote, they believe Wechat will bring them more privacy).

A total of 95 works (groups) of 91 Chinese artists are exhibited in this exhibition, covering various forms of media such as paintings, sculptures, installations, videos, and animations. The concept of the exhibition theme "Duration" comes from the French philosopher Bergson, who believes that duration means uninterrupted and eternal continuity, as well as eternal change. Every moment is an absorption of the past, and the endless possibilities of the future are based on the past and the present.


This gallery is very active and prosperous locally. It provides a local art market where artists can post their works and collectors can choose the paintings they admire. The market is also the main source of income for galleries. China's long history has brought a wide variety of festivals, which means that art museums can also sell gifts and cultural creations. An active local market contributes to the construction of an artistic and cultural atmosphere, which is rare in cities of the same size in China. I believe that it will develop domestically and internationally in the future, or experience some new technologies and sales growth.
Nowadays, Asian distributors have increased by 15%, and European distributors have fallen by 7%. Imagine this big populous but small city will have great development in the future.
