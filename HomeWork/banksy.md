Q:如何分钱，纳税，和佣金

A:没有公开的信息，苏富比已经完成的拍卖里没有写，我只在它的服务条款里面找到这个term
> Sotheby’s will collect any applicable sales tax, compensating use tax, VAT, consumption tax, goods or services tax or other indirect taxes, luxury tax, excise tax, and duties or tariffs on the purchase of NFTs where and as required by applicable law. In most cases, such determination will be based on the billing address of the Buyer. For the lots that include physical objects associated with them, tax may be collected on those lots based on the physical delivery address and not billing address.

> Most states that impose sales taxes allow for specified exemptions to the tax. For example, a registered re-seller such as a registered art dealer may purchase without incurring a tax liability, and Sotheby’s is not required to collect sales tax from such re-seller. The art dealer, when re-selling the property, may be required to charge sales tax to its client, or the client may be required to self-assess sales or use tax upon acquiring the property. Sotheby’s is required to request a properly completed resale certificate to document that the purchase is for resale. If you wish to provide a resale certificate for your purchase, please contact our Post Sale Services team.

> The winning bidders will be provided with a declaration statement, which they will be required to complete to provide us with the billing address, and return to Sotheby’s, along with supporting documentation for that billing address, before an invoice can be issued.
